            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        </p>

        <p class="pt-5"><h2>What is NYCBusWatcher?</h2>
        NYCBusWatcher is an ongoing research project that aims to collect, analyze, and archive real-time location data of vehicles in the MTA New York City bus system. It was launched in September 2020 with the goal of monitoring bus service during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic including:
        <ul>
            <li>reduced travel speeds due to the resumption of vehicle traffic, </li>
            <li>schedule changes due to MTA's deteriorating fiscal situation, </li>
            <li>and crowding conditions indicated by new vehicle occupancy sensors deployed by the MTA on selected vehicles in 2020.</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <p class="pt-5"><h2>What do the colored dots indicate?</h2>
        Each dot represents a bus in active service. Colored dots range from red (heavily loaded) to green (lightly loaded), and are sized based on the total number of passengers. Black dots do not have occupancy sensors installed and are not reporting passenger counts. Positions are updated every 60 seconds.</p>


        <p class="pt-5"><h2>Isn't someone else already doing this?</h2>
        Transit Center's <a href="http://busturnaround.nyc/report-cards/">Bus Turnaround Report Card</a> effort has been ongoing for many years and produced a number of well-documented <a href="https://github.com/Bus-Data-NYC">tools</a> and data sources. NYC BusWatcher is building on that work and exploring new directions for how to use and share this data.


        <p class="pt-5"><h2>Who made it?</h2>
        NYC BusWatcher is produced by <a href="https://urbantech.jacobs.cornell.edu/">the Urban Tech Hub</a>, part of the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech.</p>

        <p class="pt-5">
        <h2>Where does the data come from?</h2>
        All data is retrieved programmatically from the <a href="https://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/Index">MTA BusTime and OneBusAway APIs</a>.</p>

       <p class="pt-5"><h2>Can I have access to the data?</h2>

        Certainly! We have an API that provides access to detailed position data. Please contact us at urbantech at cornell.edu for access.</p>
